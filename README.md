# 🧠 Memory Forensics for Malware Analysis

A lightweight Python tool to capture and analyze memory dumps for detecting suspicious processes and malware activities.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on providing a basic memory forensics framework with two main functionalities:
- **Memory Dumping**: Capture the memory of active system processes.
- **Memory Analysis**: Analyze the dumped memory to detect anomalies, hidden processes, or signatures indicative of malware presence.

It is intended as an educational tool and a starting point for deeper memory forensics and malware analysis research.
